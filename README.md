# Launchpad - Crimson Code 2023

## Project
We wanted to relate the theme of 'Try Something New' to us as freshman, who are trying something new ourselves: college. We wished we had a tool to help us get ready for college, so we decided to make one! When you click launch, we'll ask you a few short questions about your college situation. For the best results, try to complete these questions at least six months before your move-in date.

After you've filled out the survey, you'll have a personalized checklist that will tell you exactly what you need to complete and when. This will give you a long-term plan for your journey towards college and hopefully make things easier for you as you enter this new era of your life!

All of the data you enter is stored locally on your computer, which means we do not have access to it! You can also export a copy of your data for your personal use.

## Issues
- When marking items as completed, refreshing will show them as incomplete (even if browser storage has them saved as complete)
- Time sorting seems to be a bit buggy, but not sure what is wrong.
