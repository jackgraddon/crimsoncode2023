# About Us

Welcome to LaunchPad!

We are college freshmen who want to make sure you, as an incoming college freshman, will have the tools you need to lift off to success!

We know it's hard to get everything organized and know when to do what as you're moving into this stage of your life. On top of new classes, you'll probably be living by yourself for the first time and dealing with new problems, like budgeting, providing food and transporation, and being responsible for your own time and space.

Once you start classes, you'll have a lot to focus on. You want to start planning what you can now. Our job is to help you figure out the details: What do I need to do? When do I need to do it?

When you click sign up, we'll ask you a few short questions about your college situation. For the best results, try to complete these questions at least six months before your move-in date.

After you've created your account, you'll have a personalized checklist that will tell you exactly what you need to complete and when. This will give you a long-term plan for your journey towards college and hopefully make things easier for you as you enter this new era of your life!
